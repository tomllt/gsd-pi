GSD Pi is a local-first coding agent for planning, implementing, verifying, and tracking project work from the command line.

It combines a terminal agent, project workflow tools, worktree-aware Git automation, and optional UI integrations so a project can move from idea to reviewed implementation with less manual coordination.

## Screenshots

GSD runs as a terminal-first TUI with optional browser dashboard controls.

## Feature Roll-Up

- **Guided terminal agent** — Start with `gsd`, configure providers, and run planned or quick coding sessions from your shell.
- **Autonomous project workflow** — Break work into milestones, slices, and tasks, then let auto mode plan, implement, verify, and advance.
- **Worktree-aware Git automation** — Keep implementation work isolated while preserving a reviewable main checkout.
- **Local project memory** — Store project requirements, decisions, runtime notes, generated plans, summaries, and validation evidence under `.gsd/`.
- **Multi-provider model routing** — Use the provider your team already has, with configurable defaults and per-phase model preferences.
- **Extension surface** — Add project-specific commands, tools, skills, and UI integrations through bundled or community extensions.
- **Terminal and web surfaces** — Use the TUI by default, or launch `gsd --web` when a visual control plane fits the work better than a terminal.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release-by-release fixes and [Legacy Release History](./docs/archive/legacy-release-history.md) for archived history before the `open-gsd/gsd-pi` baseline.

## Latest Release Highlights

- **Claude Opus 4.8 support** — Add the latest Claude model option to the generated model catalog.
- **Better `/gsd` observability** — Add `/gsd usage` and `/gsd context` commands for inspecting session usage and context state.
- **Sharper skill scoping** — Scope the skill catalog per unit, trim duplicate prompt surfaces, and apply unit-context manifest policy during auto-mode dispatch.
- **Improved guided installs** — Redesign the `npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest` flow so first-time and scripted installs are clearer and more reliable.
- **Smoother auto-mode progress** — Improve requirements backlog handling, completion summaries, quick branch inference, cleanup logic, and milestone closeout behavior.
- **Cloud MCP gateway runtime** — Add the local cloud MCP gateway runtime with persisted auth state.
- **More reliable installs** — Resolve native engine packages to the matching release version across npm installs and Docker images.

## Status

This repository is starting a new development baseline at version `1.0.0` under the `open-gsd/gsd-pi` project.

Older release history has been archived outside the active changelog so new work can be reviewed from a clean project surface.

## Install

Recommended — guided installer:

```bash
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
```

For CI or scripted installs:

```bash
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest --yes
```

Alternative — direct npm global install:

```bash
npm install -g @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
```

If you want pnpm to own the global install, use pnpm's runner:

```bash
pnpm setup
exec $SHELL -l
pnpm dlx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
```

Source: [`open-gsd/gsd-pi`](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-pi).

## Migrate From Older Installs

GSD Pi now installs from the scoped package `@opengsd/gsd-pi`. If you previously installed the older unscoped `gsd-pi` package, remove it first so the old global binary does not shadow the new package.

Recommended migration with the guided `npx` installer:

```bash
npm uninstall -g gsd-pi @opengsd/gsd-pi
rm -f ~/.gsd/.update-check ~/.gsd/agent/managed-resources.json
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
command -v gsd
gsd --version
```

If the old package was installed with `sudo npm install -g`, use `sudo npm uninstall -g gsd-pi` for the old package removal.

To migrate from old npm globals to a pnpm-owned global install:

```bash
npm uninstall -g gsd-pi @opengsd/gsd-pi
rm -f ~/.gsd/.update-check ~/.gsd/agent/managed-resources.json
pnpm setup
exec $SHELL -l
pnpm dlx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
command -v gsd
gsd --version
```

Windows PowerShell with the guided `npx` installer:

```powershell
npm uninstall -g gsd-pi @opengsd/gsd-pi
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.gsd\.update-check" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.gsd\agent\managed-resources.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
where.exe gsd
gsd --version
```

After migration, routine upgrades use:

```bash
gsd upgrade
```

You can also run `npx @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest` to launch the guided installer (recommended for new installs). For deeper recovery steps, see [Upgrade GSD Pi](./docs/user-docs/getting-started.md#upgrade-gsd-pi) and [Upgrade from older gsd-pi installs](./docs/user-docs/troubleshooting.md#upgrade-from-older-gsd-pi-installs).

## Uninstall

Remove the global package and optional local GSD state files.

macOS / Linux:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @opengsd/gsd-pi gsd-pi
rm -rf ~/.gsd
```

If you installed GSD with pnpm, use pnpm for the pnpm-owned package. If pnpm reports that its global bin directory is not on `PATH`, run `pnpm setup`, restart your shell, then retry.

```bash
pnpm remove -g @opengsd/gsd-pi
npm uninstall -g gsd-pi
rm -rf ~/.gsd
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
npm uninstall -g @opengsd/gsd-pi gsd-pi
Remove-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.gsd" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Quick Start

Need help choosing settings? Use the [GSD Pi web configurator](https://pi.opengsd.net/) to build a configuration in your browser.

```bash
gsd
```

Run the setup flow, choose your preferred model provider, and open a project directory. GSD stores project planning and runtime state in `.gsd/`.

For a full first-run walkthrough, see [Getting Started With gsd-pi](./docs/user-docs/getting-started.md).

## Common Session Commands

Start GSD from your shell:

```bash
gsd
```

Then use slash commands inside the GSD session:

```text
/gsd config
/gsd auto
/gsd quick "Describe the task"
/gsd status
```

## What GSD Pi Does

- Plans work into milestones, slices, and tasks.
- Runs coding sessions with project context and verification steps.
- Uses Git worktrees to isolate implementation work.
- Tracks project state in a local database with markdown projections for review.
- Supports extension-based tools and provider integrations.
- Produces artifacts such as plans, summaries, validation notes, and reports.

pnpm run verify:merge   # Before PR review: full CI blocking parity
```

## Versioning

The active public baseline starts at `1.0.0`.

Historical tags and archived refs may exist for traceability, but active release notes should be written from this baseline forward.
