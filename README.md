<!-- GSD Pi - Project overview and setup guide -->

# GSD Pi

GSD Pi is a local-first coding agent for planning, implementing, verifying, and tracking project work from the command line.

It combines a terminal agent, project workflow tools, worktree-aware Git automation, and optional UI integrations so a project can move from idea to reviewed implementation with less manual coordination.

## Status

This repository is starting a new development baseline at version `1.0.0` under the `open-gsd/gsd-pi` project.

Older release history has been archived outside the active changelog so new work can be reviewed from a clean project surface.

## Install

Install from npm (not by cloning this repo):

```bash
npm install -g @opengsd/gsd-pi@latest
```

Source: [`open-gsd/gsd-pi`](https://github.com/open-gsd/gsd-pi).

Upgrading or migrating from an older install? See [Upgrade GSD Pi](./docs/user-docs/getting-started.md#upgrade-gsd-pi) and, if needed, [Upgrade from older GSD-2 installs](./docs/user-docs/troubleshooting.md#upgrade-from-older-gsd-2-installs).

## Quick Start

```bash
gsd
```

Run the setup flow, choose your preferred model provider, and open a project directory. GSD stores project planning and runtime state in `.gsd/`.

For a full first-run walkthrough, see [Getting Started With GSD2](./docs/user-docs/getting-started.md).

## Common Session Commands

Start GSD from your shell:

```bash
gsd
```

Then use slash commands inside the GSD session:

```text
/gsd config
/gsd auto
/gsd quick "Describe the task"
/gsd status
```

## What GSD Pi Does

- Plans work into milestones, slices, and tasks.
- Runs coding sessions with project context and verification steps.
- Uses Git worktrees to isolate implementation work.
- Tracks project state in a local database with markdown projections for review.
- Supports extension-based tools and provider integrations.
- Produces artifacts such as plans, summaries, validation notes, and reports.
